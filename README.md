BACK_TO_THE_PAST_Î” :


Description :

This game was developed during a 48-hour game jam organized by 42 Roma Luiss school. The theme of the game jam was "Si stava meglio quando si stava peggio" (It was better when it was worse). Our team, consisting of four members, interpreted this theme as "Back to the Past" and created a game divided into three levels.

Level 1: Modern Era (2D Bird's Eye)

The first level is set in the modern era, featuring a 2D bird's eye perspective. Players navigate through contemporary surroundings, setting the stage for the journey back in time.

Level 2: Retro Era (2D)

In the second level, players travel back to a retro era both in terms of style and setting. The game transitions to a 2D environment, capturing the essence of a bygone era.

Level 3: Prehistoric Era (Pong Remake)

The third and final level takes players to the prehistoric era, paying homage to the classic game "Pong." This level serves as a nostalgic nod to the early days of gaming while incorporating the overall theme of the game jam.
